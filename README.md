    Description
     My church hosts a grief group for those who are struggling with a loss.  The App accomplishes, tracking the members and who they have have lost.  In the future this will also track all contact information and emergency contact information

     The app has two parts, a backend react router and serve, and a react front end
     My app currently is composed of 2 components and I have the data to make 3

     On the first component members can see members, who they have lost and what year
     then second component will have all contact information for members

    Brief Example
        By accessing the web site, New members can be added and tracked.  This gives an easy access way to keep the information updated and at hand when needed
